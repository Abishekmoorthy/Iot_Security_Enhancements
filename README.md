# IoT Security: A Comparative Study of Traditional and Blockchain-Based Security Measures

## Project Overview
IoT devices face numerous security challenges, including data breaches and privacy risks. Traditional security methods often lack scalability and reliability, while blockchain offers a decentralized and secure alternative. This project evaluates and compares traditional and blockchain-based security measures to determine the optimal solution for IoT systems.
