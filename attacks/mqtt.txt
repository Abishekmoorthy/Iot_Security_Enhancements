MQTT

- Remote Memory Leak with QoS 2 Messages (CVE-2023–28366): Vulnerability affecting the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker, where handling Quality of Service (QoS) level 2 messages can lead to a remote memory leak. This issue can allow attackers to exhaust system memory, potentially creating a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.


- Insecure Default Configuration (CVE-2017–7650): This vulnerability affects some Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT brokers, where the default configuration does not enforce authentication. This insecure default setting allows attackers to connect to the broker without credentials, potentially leading to unauthorised access and data leakage.


- Excessive CPU Consumption with Empty Connection (CVE-2023–5632): In the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker, before and including 2.0.5, an empty connection request can cause excessive CPU consumption. This flaw allows attackers to potentially create a DoS condition by exhausting CPU resources through repeated empty connection attempts.


- Subscription Revocation Issue (CVE-2021–34434): In the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker, improper handling of subscription revocation can lead to unauthorised message delivery. This bug allows attackers to continue receiving messages on revoked subscriptions, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorised data access.


- Buffer Overflow (CVE-2020–11976): Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in MQTT implementations could be exploited to run remote code execution attacks. This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and cause a DoS condition by crashing the servers running vulnerable MQTT software.
