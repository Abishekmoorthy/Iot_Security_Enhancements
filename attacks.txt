CoAP

The Selective Blocking Attack

   The selective blocking attack is possible even if a security protocol
   like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is used.  Encryption makes selective
   blocking of messages harder, but not impossible or even infeasible.
   With DTLS and TLS, proxies can read the complete CoAP message, and
   with OSCORE, the CoAP header and several CoAP options are not
   encrypted.  In all three security protocols, the IP-addresses, ports,
   and CoAP message lengths are available to all on-path attackers,
   which may be enough to determine the server, resource, and command.


 The Request Delay Attack

   An on-path attacker may not only block packets, but can also delay
   the delivery of a selectively chosen packet (request or response) by
   a chosen amount of time.


The Response Delay and Mismatch Attack

   The attacker performs the attack by delaying delivery of a response
   until the client sends a request with the same token, the response
   will be accepted by the client as a valid response to the later
   request.


The Request Fragment Rearrangement Attack

   These attack scenarios show that the Request Delay and Blocking
   Attacks can be used against block-wise transfers to cause
   unauthorized operations to be performed on the server, and responses
   to unauthorized operations to be mistaken for responses to authorized
   operations.  The combination of these attacks is described as a
   separate attack because it makes the Request Delay Attack relevant to
   systems that are otherwise not time-dependent, which means that they
   could disregard the Request Delay Attack.


The Relay Attack

   Yet another type of attack can be performed in deployments where
   actuator actions are triggered automatically based on proximity and
   without any user interaction, e.g., a car (the client) constantly
   polling for the car key (the server) and unlocking both doors and
   engine as soon as the car key responds.  An attacker (or pair of
   attackers) may simply relay the CoAP messages out-of-band
